            <h1> <span>Skip</span> The Diet,<br>Just Eat Healthy <br>With Food Network</h1>
            <p>I think If someone try to become healthy he doesn't need a diet plan. If one tries to follow a food
                network and eat healthy food avoid oily,fast food, and all juk-food he might will have e good health.
